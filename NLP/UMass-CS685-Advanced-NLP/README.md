## Readings

A nice textbook for NLP fundamentals is [Jurafsky and Martin, *Speech and Language Processing*, 3rd ed](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). For this course, readings will mainly be NLP conference papers (e.g., from ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP). We will post all readings as PDFs.

Other useful texts for NLP include:

- [Manning and Schütze, *Foundations of Stat NLP*](http://cognet.mit.edu.silk.library.umass.edu/library/books/view?isbn=0262133601). Free access at UMass.
- [Eisenstein, *Natural Language Processing*](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf). Draft textbook.
- [Smith, *Linguistic Structure Prediction*](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nasmith/LSP/). Free access at UMass. Short book. Excellent coverage of structured prediction inference methods for NLP.
- [Murphy, *Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective*](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/). Excellent, though advanced, coverage of most of the machine learning methods we will use.
- [Bender, *Linguistic Fundamentals for NLP*](http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00493ED1V01Y201303HLT020). Short book. Focuses on linguisic issues relevant to NLP.
- [Bird et al, *NLP with Python*](http://www.nltk.org/book/), a.k.a. the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) book. Aimed at a more introductory level than this course, but the book is a good gentle introduction to NLP with a CL (computational linguistics) emphasis. The NLTK software has easy-to-use data access and some interfaces to (not always SOTA) NLP tools.
